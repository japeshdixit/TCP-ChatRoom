# TCP-ChatRoom
 
 This is a project  to understand how  tcp/ip connections work
 I have used sockets and threading concepts to implement this .
 It simply runs on your localhost and port specified by the user
 
 thread is a sequence of instructions within a program 
 running several threads is equivalent to running differnet programs
 server plays intermediatary for client A to client B connection
